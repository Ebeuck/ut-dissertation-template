\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:intro}

Most of the settings are the same as those provided in the original dissertation template, created by Tony Saad, with a few changes to reflect the  \href{http://gradschool.utk.edu/thesesdissertations/}{updated formatting requirements}. These changes are (in no particular order):

 \begin{itemize} 
 	\item A new \textit{hypothesis} environment, in addition to the \textit{theorem, correlary,} and \textit{lemma} environments. For example: \hyperref[hyp:3a]{Hypothesis \ref{hyp:3a}} and \ref{hyp:3b}. 
 	\item Margins were changed to the following:
	 	\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt} 
	 		\item[] \begin{verbatim}
			 		left = 1.25in,
			 		right = 1.25in,
			 		top = 1.0in,
			 		bottom = 1.375in
			 		\end{verbatim} \vspace*{-2em}
	 	\end{itemize}
	 \item 	Several packages were added, such as \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/longtable?lang=en}{\textsf{longtable}},  \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/multirow}{\textsf{multirow}}, \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tabularx}{\textsf{tabularx}}, and \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf}{\textsf{TikZ/pgf}}. 
	 \item Note the file path for figures. I grouped them by chapter (e.g. `ch3' \& `ch4'):
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item[] \begin{verbatim}
		 	\graphicspath{{figures/}{figures/ch3/}{figures/ch4/}}
		 	\end{verbatim} \vspace*{-2em}
		 \end{itemize}
 	\item Additionally, there were a few stylistic changes, such as changing `Contents' to `Table of Contents,' adding Appendices to the Table of Contents, moving the Bibliography title to its own page, and changes to the color of links, references, etc. 
 	\item Other considerations/changes to make:
	 	\begin{itemize} 
	 		\item If you have tables/figures you want to turn sideways, \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/landscape?lang=en}{\textsf{landscape}} environment provides this, but you must manually rotate each page using Adobe (or other PDF editor) after you compile the document. 
	 		\item If you need to use \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/longtable?lang=en}{\textsf{longtable}} environment the , you will need to include a `first header' and `second header' that includes the table name, number, and ``\textit{Continued from previous page}'' (e.g. \hyperref[longtable]{Table \ref{longtable}}). 
	 		\item ``Table'' and ``Figure'' labels need to go above and below the table and figure, respectively (e.g. \hyperref[table]{Table \ref{table}} \& \hyperref[figure]{Figure \ref{figure}}). 
	 		\item Tables were made using \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf}{\textsf{stargazer}} in R \citep{stargazer}.
	 	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
